Looper is a mobile game that was entirely developed by me. It is a simple infinite runner with over 5 million downloads. It's available on both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.danielcruz.sines&hl=en_US&gl=US) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/looper-minimal-infinite-runner/id1265535862).
